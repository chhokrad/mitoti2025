        <h3>International Workshop on Middleware for IT/OT Integration (MITOTI 2025)</h3>
		<div style="overflow: auto;">
			
		<p>
		<img src="assets/mitoti.jpeg" alt="MITOTI Workshop" style="float: right; margin-left: 25px; height: 450px; width:450px">
            IT/OT integration bridges the gap between Information Technology
            (IT) systems, which manage data and business processes, and
            Operational Technology (OT) systems, which control and monitor
            industrial operations. It is a foundational element to drive digital
            transformation across industries. This convergence enables real-time
            data sharing and collaboration between enterprise-level applications
            and physical machinery, leading to smarter decision-making, improved
            efficiency, enhanced productivity, greater operational transparency,
            and enhanced safety. Developing middleware for integrated solutions
            that bridge the digital and physical worlds unlocks the full
            potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and paves the
            way for smarter, more resilient operations. Despite challenges like
            legacy systems and differing priorities, successful IT/OT
            integration is a cornerstone of modern, data-driven industrial
            environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary goal of this workshop is to address the challenges and
            present advanced and innovative algorithms, models, techniques,
            architectures, specifications, tools, and frameworks that bring
            diverse middleware technologies at the interaction of Information
            Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). 
        </p>
