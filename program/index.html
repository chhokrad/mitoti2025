    <h3>The Digital Fabric of Resilience: Integrating IoT, IT, and OT for the Cyber-Power Grid</h3>
    
    <h4><b>Prof. Anurag K Srivastava</b>, Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Director, Smart Grid REsiliency and Analytics Lab (SG-REAL)
    West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA. Senior Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Richland, WA
    </h4>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>As the electric grid evolves into a complex cyber-physical-human system, the seamless integration of Information Technology (IT), 
        Operational Technology (OT), and Internet of Things (IoT) services has become critical to ensure grid resilience, security, and flexibility.
         Middleware technologies form the digital fabric that interweaves these layers, enabling real-time coordination, situational awareness,
          and distributed intelligence across the grid ecosystem. This talk explores how middleware and IoT-enabled services can enhance
     cyber-power grid resilience through scalable communication, computing and control architectures. Requirements for centralized,
      distributed, and decentralized control architectures will be discussed highlighting their respective implications for communication, 
      computing, reliability, and system autonomy. Key topics include: a) Resilience-aware control architecture, b) Example of middleware
       including RIAPS, DCBlocks, GridStat including fog and edge computing for flexible orchestration enabling distributed, time-sensitive control
        and fault-tolerant coordination, c) Digital twin with IT/OT for validating control strategies and assessing resilience under cyber-physical stressors,
         d) Human-in-the-loop frameworks to couple operator cognition with adaptive, data-driven decision support.
          The presentation will highlight how a digitally woven, middleware-enabled fabric, linking IoT, IT, and OT, 
          with metrics can transform the power grid into a flexible, and resilient infrastructure.</p>
